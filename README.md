This mod supports split-screen and the position of the energy text is
customizable in-game when [Generic Mod Config

## Acknowledgements

_DisplayEnergy_ was based off the
[EnergyCount](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4272) mod, thank you
_Crystallyne_ for creating that mod. I decided to create _DisplayEnergy_ when I
realized _EnergyCount_ didn't support split-screen. Later on, I made the
position of the energy text customizable.
